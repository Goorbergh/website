## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

I'm a former economics teacher and currently working toward obtaining an MSc in Methods and Statistics. At the moment I am working on a research project regarding imbalanced data and the performance of medical prediction models under supervision of Dr. Maarten van Smeden and Dr. Ben Van Calster. Additionally I'm involved in a project of the Human Data Science lab of Utrecht University where we aim to automize the process of de-identificating social media data.

My professional interest lies at the interface of data science and strategy.  I combine technical knowledge of statistics and machine learning with the ability to communicate about these topics in a clear manner. My goal is to utilize my skill set to bridge the gap between machine learning experts and end users.
